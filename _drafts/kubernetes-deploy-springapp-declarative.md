On the previous post (TODO: insert post link here), we have seen how to deploy spring petclinic application on kubernetes.
We have deployed it using an imperative approach by running kubectl run commands.

On this post, we will rewrite the deployment process using a declarative approach.
By declarative we means :
TODO : explain here

# Deployement object

# Service object

# Replica set object

# Config maps object
